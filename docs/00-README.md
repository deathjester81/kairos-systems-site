# Kairos Systems – Internal Website Mock (v1)

## Purpose
Internal one-pager mock to align Kai + Fabri on positioning, tone, and experience.
This is NOT a public website yet. Expect placeholders.

## Goals (v1)
- One-page scroll narrative with anchor navigation
- Strong Hero + Problem + "Holistic System" authority section
- Clear "How we work", compact People, minimal Contact
- Copy centralized (easy iteration without touching JSX)

## Non-Goals (v1)
- No SEO perfection
- No final branding, name, legal text
- No public testimonials/logos without explicit permission
- No production-grade audit tool yet (placeholder only)

## Repo Structure (important)
- All copy lives in `src/lib/copy.ts`
- Sections live in `src/components/sections/*`
- Page composition lives in `src/app/page.tsx`
