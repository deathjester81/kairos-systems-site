# Cursor Instructions (Kairos Website)

- Keep changes small and reversible.
- Do not change directory structure.
- All copy lives in `src/lib/copy.ts`.
- Keep section IDs stable (hero, problem, system, perspective, how, reflection, people, contact).
- No new dependencies unless asked.
- If unsure, ask before large refactors.
